          <h2>Maker of Modern India</h2>
          <p>
            Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher,
            and social reformer. He was a chief disciple of the 19th-century
            mystic Ramakrishna and a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta
            and Yoga to the West. He is often called the "Messenger of Indian
            Wisdom" or the "Maker of Modern India". Vivekananda was born
            Narendranath Datta in Calcutta, India. He was a brilliant student
            and a natural leader. He was also deeply interested in spirituality,
            and he began to study the Hindu scriptures at a young age. In 1881,
            Vivekananda met Ramakrishna, a Hindu mystic who became his guru.
            Ramakrishna taught Vivekananda about the importance of devotion,
            service, and renunciation.
